# Rebel Test Project
At least I tried. (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)



## Getting started
Please ensure you have Node installed
1) Create an empty project folder
2) In your shell terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/hongthang152/rebel-test.git
cd rebel-test
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```
3) Voilà. Go to http://localhost:5000

## Disclaimer
It is my first time using redux so please excuse my bad coding practice.
